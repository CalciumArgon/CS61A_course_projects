## TODO
- Scheme Interpreter

## What I learn
- The projects are technically fancy and interesting to tackle with.
- The framework of each lab written by TA is informative and useful, from which I learned a lot about how to construct a long programme.
- Solid exercise of OOP in Python, which enormously enhance my skill of data/programme abstraction.
